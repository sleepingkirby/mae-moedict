notes for windows compile for qt

*make sure previous bulid compiles. If it doesn't you know it's the environment.*

1) start the command prompt under Qt 5.6 5.6 msvc 2013 64 bit
2) inthe command prompt, run "vcvarsall.bat amd64"
(this is usually in C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\) amd64 is for when compiling for 64 bit
3) cd into the source and run "nmake clean"
4) then run "nmake"
5) then run "nmake install"?

Keep in mind that the linux and windows versions use different libraries and different codes.
 - QWebView --> QWebEngineView
 - clickTBP is a page that needs to be stored into a QWebEngineView
 - All <a href needs to have a protocol or it'll fail. Having it set to "def:" Fail as in the page redirects to a blank, the emit override doesn't happen
 - different code in general and functions
